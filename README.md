Swirlogram plots with Bezier Splines

## Introduction

Swirlograms are a good way to visualise how the data in a scatter plot varies with time 

An example from the web:
![An example of a Swirlogram](http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/52fbfa8c69bedd3118905b64-1200-900/markets_cotd-new-3.png?maxX=800)

We want to be able to interpolate between successive data points to create a smooth curve which runs through the points in chronological order.

bezier_splines.py contains the class Bezier providing a method plot() that creates a swirlogram given a DataFrame with x and y columns.

The splines are generated by solving the system of equations defining a set of connected bezier curves that are C2 continuous at the data points.
We can add directional arrows to the swirlogram to highlight how the data is drifting by using de Casteljau's algorithm to evaluate the tangent to each curve segment.

Example:
```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np


import matplotlib.path as mpath
import matplotlib.patches as mpatches
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from bezier_splines import Bezier

# Data processing
# Data from https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/AHETPI
# We will plot the month-on-month % change (y-axis) in US average hourly earnings
# vs the year-on-year equivalent (x-axis)

df = pd.read_csv('AHETPI.csv', index_col=0).tail(36)
df.index = pd.to_datetime(df.index)

mom = df.pct_change() * 100
mom.columns = ['% MoM']
yoy = df.pct_change(12) * 100
yoy.columns=  ['% YoY']

data = yoy.join(mom).dropna()


# Plot the graph

swirlogram = Bezier(data)
swirlogram.plot(arrow_width=0.0175)

swirlogram.ax.scatter(data['% YoY'], data['% MoM'], s=16, c='r')

swirlogram.ax.set_xlim((2.4,3.9))
swirlogram.ax.set_ylim((0,0.55))
swirlogram.ax.set_xlabel('% chg YoY')
swirlogram.ax.set_ylabel('% chg MoM')

swirlogram.fig.suptitle('Swirlogram: Last 2Y Wage Growth')
swirlogram.fig.subplots_adjust(
top=0.902,
bottom=0.122,
left=0.104,
right=0.953,
hspace=0.2,
wspace=0.2
)
```
